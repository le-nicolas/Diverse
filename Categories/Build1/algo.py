START
    1. Initialize sensors (GPS, accelerometer, gyroscope, camera).
    2. Set speed limits and violation thresholds:
        - Speed limit (e.g., 60 km/h)
        - Acceleration threshold (e.g., 2.0 g)
        - Define violation types (e.g., speeding, reckless driving)

LOOP: Repeat continuously
    3. Fetch current GPS data (speed, location):
        - speed = get_current_speed(GPS)
        - location = get_current_location(GPS)
    
    4. Fetch accelerometer and gyroscope data:
        - accel_data = get_acceleration()
        - gyro_data = get_orientation()
    
    5. Check for violations:
        a. SPEED VIOLATION:
            IF speed > speed_limit:
                - Log violation (speed, location, timestamp)
                - Optionally start recording video
                
        b. RECKLESS DRIVING:
            - Calculate total acceleration (sqrt(ax^2 + ay^2 + az^2))
            IF total_acceleration > acceleration_threshold:
                - Log violation (acceleration, location, timestamp)
                - Optionally start recording video

    6. Store violation data:
        - Store to SD card or send to cloud
        - Optionally display alert or log in mobile app

    7. (Optional) Stop recording if violation ends or time limit is reached.

    8. Wait for a short delay (e.g., 1 second) before the next loop.

part 2?
1. Initialize system
   a. Connect to GPS module, accelerometer, gyroscope, and camera
   b. Set speed limit (either globally or based on GPS location data)
   c. Define thresholds for reckless riding (e.g., acceleration > 2.0 m/s², lean angle > 45 degrees)

2. Continuously capture sensor data
   a. Capture GPS data (latitude, longitude, speed)
   b. Capture accelerometer and gyroscope data (acceleration, tilt, angle)
   c. Optionally, capture visual data (camera feed)

3. Process data
   a. Extract speed from GPS data
   b. Calculate total acceleration and angular data from sensors
   c. Optionally, analyze camera feed to detect road signs (e.g., red lights, stop signs)

4. Violation detection logic
   a. Check for speeding:
      - IF (current speed > speed limit)
        - Log a "Speeding" violation
        - Trigger camera to record video (10 seconds before and after event)
   b. Check for reckless riding:
      - IF (total acceleration > reckless acceleration threshold OR tilt angle > tilt threshold)
        - Log a "Reckless Riding" violation
        - Trigger camera to record video (10 seconds before and after event)
   c. Check for lane violations (optional):
      - IF (GPS location within restricted area, e.g., bike lane or sidewalk)
        - Log a "Lane Violation"
        - Trigger camera to record video

5. Log violations:
   a. Save violation data (timestamp, type, location, speed, sensor data) in a CSV or database
   b. Optionally upload data to cloud or sync with smartphone app

6. Provide feedback to rider (optional):
   a. IF violation detected
      - Flash warning lights or beep alert
      - Display violation information on screen (if available)

7. Repeat steps 2–6 continuously
