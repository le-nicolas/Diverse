#how do i make a dataset for rocket stove?
# Features:
#Temperature: The temperature inside the combustion chamber (in degrees Celsius).
#Airflow: The rate of airflow into the stove (in cubic meters per second).
#Fuel Moisture: The moisture content in the fuel (as a percentage).
#Fuel Type: The type of fuel used (categorical variable, e.g., wood, charcoal).
#Combustion Chamber Insulation: The type or quality of insulation used (categorical variable).
#Environmental Temperature: The ambient temperature outside the stove (in degrees Celsius).
#Wind Speed: The wind speed around the stove (in meters per second).
#Operator Experience: The experience level of the person operating the stove (categorical variable, e.g., novice, experienced).
#Outcome: The result of the stove operation (binary variable: 0 for positive outcome, 1 for negative outcome).






#why?
#Temperature: Affects combustion efficiency and heat output.
#Airflow: Influences how well the fire burns; too little or too much can be problematic.
#Fuel Moisture: High moisture content can make ignition and sustained combustion difficult.
#Fuel Type: Different fuels have varying combustion characteristics.
#Combustion Chamber Insulation: Insulation can help maintain high temperatures for better combustion.
#Environmental Temperature: Can affect the stove's performance and efficiency.
#Wind Speed: Wind can influence the airflow and combustion process.
